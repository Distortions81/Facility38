Intro:

  You are an engineer working within Facility 38, a subterranean bunker designed to survive cataclysmic events.

Work on the facility was not yet complete, but war suddenly broke out... and resulted in a full nuclear exchange.

You are the only person who was in facility at the time. The bunker is stocked with food and water

for a large number of people, but it is not yet habitable long-term. You must use your skills and ingenuity

to survive in this new world. The rock and concrete will protect you from the radiation for now. But you must

find a way to produce fuel, oxygen and other resources in the short-term... before the reserves here run out.

You scan the radio for any signs of life, but so far all you find is silence.
