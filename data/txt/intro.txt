Intro: (game is in early development)

  You are an engineer working on Facility 38, a subterranean bunker designed to survive cataclysmic events.

Construction was in progress, but war suddenly breaks out... and resulted in a full nuclear exchange.

You are the only person who was working in facility at the time. The bunker is stocked with food and water

for a large number of people, but it is not habitable long-term. You must use your skills and ingenuity

to survive in this new world. The rock and concrete will protect you from the radiation for now. But you must

find a way to produce fuel, oxygen and other resources in the short-term as they are in short supply.

You scan the radio for any signs of life, but there is nothing... Only radio silence.
