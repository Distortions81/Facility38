  You are an engineer working on Facility 38, a subterranean bunker designed to survive cataclysmic events.
Construction was in progress, but suddenly war breaks out... resulting in a full nuclear exchange.
You are the only person who was within the facility at the time. The bunker is stocked with food and water
for a large number of people, but it is not habitable long-term. You must use your skills and ingenuity
to survive in this new world. The rock and soil will protect you from the radiation for now, but you must
find a way to produce oxygen and other resources in the short-term.

You scan the radio for any signs of life, but there is nothing. Only radio silence.
