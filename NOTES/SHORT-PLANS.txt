#HELPFUL INFO
-tags=ebitenginedebug
export EBITENGINE_INTERNAL_IMAGES_KEY=Q


High priority:

Timers, pressure switches, item spilling.
Add TotalMined to save/load
Multi-tile objects, ABCDEF port format. Use modulo rotation.
Start investigating server/client and tock/tick spreading.

Optimizations:
Carefully look at entire draw() loop, update() loop, and ticks/tocks.

Try to remove any unneeded info in objdata, port data, and all children.
Optimize camera and mouse position calculations.
optimize object camera x/y calculations, and mouse world and mouse screen calculations
Stop recalculating camera/zoom/world mouse, do once per frame.

Start inserting objects in-order in chunks.
Possibly move to 32-row lists.
Complete unsafe for faster loading, make packed binary format for saves.
make totalmined map for quick rendering, rebuild on load.

Other:
Fix multi-tile objects failing at chunk border (draw ground, then items)
*** Add surface ID/Name to XY?, parent/child surfaces.
eventually set machine times in ms/sec
Add ground rendering for pixel mode too
adjustable miners/furnace speeds
Add ground water and surface water. Mineralized, fresh and salt.
Water should get contaminated by dumping.


Currently we do not remove/replace sub-obj on rotate (does not support non-square!) fix me
0: x,y
1: -y, x
2: -x, -y
3: y, -x

eventually sleep/wake objects if blocked or no input.
