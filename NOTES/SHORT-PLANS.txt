tickinterval lists, so items can run every Nth tick
Game objects need folders and JSON files with links to the sprites and other data.
WASM try to patch mouse lost when going off-screen stupidity, also spread ticks


Current Priority:
Draw a ghost for pending delete/add object... maybe add timer for construct/deconstruct.

support larger items, use pointers or additional maps/lists?

Set object input and output directions in defs instead of trying all directions,
possibly even make user manually specify (no default input/output?)

Think about how we want to handle many materials, and types quickly but without insane memory use.
:: We could possibly use one material type that has a bitflag, even allowing mixed materials.
