Issues moved to github
https://github.com/Distortions81/GameTest/issues


Minimize nested ifs
occupied map, with pointers and x/y cords for building piece info
adjustable miners/furnace speeds

high priority:
splitters, over/under, hoppers
eventually set machine times in ms/sec

Make mouse tooltip show minerals in mineral mode.
make UI with checkboxes for mineral selection to draw

Add ground rendering for pixel mode too
Possibly look at further cleaning of object types:
	SubTypes = [][]*world.ObjType{
		UIObjsTypes,
		GameObjTypes,
		ObjOverlayTypes,
		TerrainTypes,
	}


Fix overs not showing sprite when rotated. Not sure how to fix that other than a special tag?
Fix delay before loading screen from mineral prerendering.
