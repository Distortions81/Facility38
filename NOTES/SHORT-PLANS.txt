High priority:
Hoppers
Timers, pressure switches, item spilling.
Tile map for mined resources, and spilled items.

Add ground water and surface water. Mineralized, fresh and salt.
Water should get contaiminated by dumping.

Multi-tile objects, ABCDEF port format. Use modulo rotation.
Fix overs not showing mats when rotated (use rotation to get righcorrect input)
obj-tock.go: Cut down code in tock, move anything we can to init.

Read should be faster than write, becuase of CPU caches...
We should always read the material type, and only reset typeP if need be.
remove uneeded port == nil checks, etc.

Other:
eventually set machine times in ms/sec
Add ground rendering for pixel mode too
Complete unsafe for faster loading, make packed binary format for saves.
Minimize nested ifs
adjustable miners/furnace speeds
