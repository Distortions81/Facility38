High priority:
hoppers
multi-tile objects, ABCDEF port format. Use modulo rotation.
Fix overs not showing mats when rotated (use rotation to get right input)
obj-tock.go: Cut down code in tock, move anything we can to init.
Read should be faster than write, becuase of CPU caches...
So we should always read the material type and only set typeP if need be.
remove uneeded port == nil checks, etc.

Other:
eventually set machine times in ms/sec
Add ground rendering for pixel mode too
Complete unsafe for faster loading, make packed binary format for saves.
Also: BP/minisave format
Minimize nested ifs
adjustable miners/furnace speeds
