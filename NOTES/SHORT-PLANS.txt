Optimize: Make uninterrupted sections of belt one entity.
Cache toolbar UI, overlay for button press or selection.

Check on belt blinking when miner replaced

** Draw a ghost for pending delete/add object **
make belt juctions

1:
make occupied map

2:
instead of maps, use 32 line blocks
chunks become multi line objects
do this so we can render and process
left to right, top to bottom

3:
add tick lists, and divide up work for every nth tick loads ---------



Performance:
cache toolbar to a single draw call
cache chunks and update each UPS for icon mode, pre-render map mode.
Only update if chunk gets marked dirty, and we are in that mode.
