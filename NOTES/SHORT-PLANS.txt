High priority:
Hoppers
Timers, pressure switches, item spilling.
Add TotalMined to save/load
make totalmined map for quick rendering, rebuild on load.
Insert objects into object list IN ORDER.
Multi-tile objects, ABCDEF port format. Use modulo rotation.
*** Fix saving breaking item links on running game ***
Start investigating server/client and tock/tick spreading.
Show ghost preview when item is selected for placing, turn red if can not place.


*** Add surface ID/Name to XY?
Start inserting objects in-order in chunks.
Possibly move to 32-row lists.

Other:
eventually set machine times in ms/sec
Add ground rendering for pixel mode too
Complete unsafe for faster loading, make packed binary format for saves.
adjustable miners/furnace speeds
Add ground water and surface water. Mineralized, fresh and salt.
Water should get contaminated by dumping.


MULTI-TILE:
List of tiles, in local x/y cords. -2,-2 to 2,2 etc.
Rotation works as expected:  (use 0,0 for center of rotation)

0: x,y
1: -y, x
2: -x, -y
3: y, -x
