Issues moved to github
https://github.com/Distortions81/GameTest/issues


Minimize nested ifs
adjustable miners/furnace speeds

high priority:
hoppers. occupied map, with pointers and x/y cords for building piece info
eventually set machine times in ms/sec

Make mouse tooltip show resources in resource mode.
make UI with checkboxes for resources selection to draw

Add ground rendering for pixel mode too
Possibly look at further cleaning of object types:
	SubTypes = [][]*world.ObjType{
		UIObjsTypes,
		GameObjTypes,
		ObjOverlayTypes,
		TerrainTypes,
	}


ALSO DO: Fix loading screen, material rendering progress, etc.
Complete unsafe for faster loading, make packed binary format for saves.
Also: BP/minisave format

Fix overs not showing mats when rotated (use rotation to get right input)
Fix delay before loading screen from resources prerendering.
