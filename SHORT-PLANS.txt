Reduce tick queue load and memory footprint. Possibly a few lists for different tick intervals, maybe process x/total per tick?

Start miner and other object outputs and inputs
Possibly cache overlays, since they change infrequently. This should reduce draw calls.

Cache toolbar UI, overlay for button press or selection.

Check if smaller ints and floats reduce memory footprint
