PRUNE INPUT BUFFERS ON OBJECT DELETE
Tick/proc event delete crashes <---- probably needs lock
DONT INIT BUFFERS IF NOT USED


Move tick/tock/proc lists to a map, where key is how many ticks before processing.
Divide by number of entries, process X per tick. Store position in list.
Eventually, we need to test if reading while being written is ACTUALLY a data race or not and if it matters.
If it does, lock per chunk. Make chunks smaller and make nested chunks for rendering speed IF NEEDED.


DONE Start miner and other object outputs and inputs
Possibly cache overlays, since they change infrequently. This should reduce draw calls.

Cache toolbar UI, overlay for button press or selection.
Check if smaller ints and floats reduce memory footprint
Go through and break up and clean code, too much duplicated code.
