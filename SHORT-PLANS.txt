Possibly use a fixed number of buffers for belts, for the max number of items they can hold. Allows for more than one object of the same type as well.... Optimize: Make uninterrupted sections of belt one entity.

Cache toolbar UI, overlay for button press or selection.
Go through and break up and clean code, too much duplicated code.

post threading:
make object create/delete handle removing proc/tick queue entries and buffers.
make a queue for deleting and adding events, after proc/tick.
Make belts support non-merged material amounts (no MAT_MAX!)

remove any memory copy/alloc we don't need... just do them on events like object create based on item type.
make item flags for proc/tick and input/output/contains, etc.




REMOVE ALL UNEEDED CHECKS ONCE CODE IS GOOD!
